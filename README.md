# CFDE Training Resources

The `stable` branch of this repository builds the public training materials for the CFDE at https://training.nih-cfde.org. The `dev` branch contains updates that will be merged as part of the next [release](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/blob/dev/docs/TrainingRepoReleasePlan/TrainingRepo-Release-Plan.md).

The training website hosts tutorials and resources to learn how to perform bioinformatic analyses and access data. The GitHub repository contains CFDE internal resources, including the [website style guide](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/Website-Style-Guide) and [website release protocol](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/Website-Style-Guide/7ReleasePlan/).

Check out our [wiki pages](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/wiki) for past workshop notes, mini tutorials on setup, and workshop attendee resources (i.e., for managing screen space).

Find answers to frequently asked questions on popular topics like AWS, Conda, Snakemake, RNA-Seq, etc. on our [Discussion Board](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/discussions). If you don't find your particular question listed, we encourage you to post a new discussion and we will ensure to answer it promptly (you'll need a GitHub account to post).

We welcome suggestions for improvements as well as tutorial topics. Submit all training suggestions via CFDE HelpDesk: training@cfde.atlassian.net
