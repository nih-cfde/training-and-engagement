Terminate AWS Instance
=======================

When you are done with all the analyses, be sure to terminate the AWS instance. If you fail to terminate your instance, AWS will keep charging you money!

!!! Warning
    Upon termination, you will lose all installations and data. Be sure to download all useful data before you terminate the instance!


 Log in to AWS and navigate to the instances page. Then select the instance and click

 "Actions" --> "Instance State" --> "Terminate"
