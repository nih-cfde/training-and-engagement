**An introduction to Snakemake for workflow management**

Workflow management systems help to automate analyses and make them easier to maintain, reproduce, and share with others. In this tutorial, we will walk through the basic steps for creating a [variant calling](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training-beta/online/courses/human-genetic-variation-introduction/variant-identification-and-analysis/) workflow with the Snakemake workflow management system.

This may not be the variant calling workflow you would necessarily use in practice, but it serves as a good example for teaching Snakemake. Many people do indeed use `samtools`, but for particularly big or complex genomes, guidelines provided by  [GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) would serve best. Additionally, various parameters associated with mapping, visualization, etc. may require tuning.

These materials were adapted from the Data Intensive Biology lab course materials ([course materials](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2020-GGG298), [lab materials](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2020-GGG201b-lab)).

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

    The objectives of this tutorial are to:
    
    - learn how to write basic workflows with Snakemake rules
    
    - learn variable substitution for Snakemake rules
    
    - learn wildcard matching for Snakemake rules
    
    - understand why workflow systems can help you do your computing more easily


=== "Prerequisites"
    
    This tutorial is written for a Unix or Linux compute environment (e.g., MacOS, Linux-based HPC, pre-configured binder). It assumes basic knowledge of navigating, editing files, and executing scripts from the command line. Some knowledge of Python is useful, but not required.
