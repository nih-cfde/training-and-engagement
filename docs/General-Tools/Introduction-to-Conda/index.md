An Introduction to Conda
============================================

Conda is a very helpful tool for easily installing, managing, and reproducing software environments used in computational workflows, such as high-throughput sequence data processing or downstream data visualization workflows to name a few!

At the end of the lesson, we'll also briefly discuss other useful applications of conda and setting up conda on your own system.

Est. Time | Lesson name | Description

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

    - Learn about conda and how to use it
    - Learn the basics of software installation, software dependencies, and isolated environments
    - Set up a conda environment
    - Learn about managing virtual environments
    - Install Miniconda

=== "Prerequisites"

    The conda lesson uses a standardized binder environment, which will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and Firefox, Safari, and Chrome web browsers.


=== "Tutorial Resources"

    Please refer to [our conda command cheat sheet](../Cheat-Sheets/conda_cheatsheet.md) and the [official conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html) for commonly used conda commands!
