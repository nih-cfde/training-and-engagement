# Using conda environments

Let's get started with conda!

To follow along with this lesson, we are using a [binder](https://binder.pangeo.io/) with an Rstudio interface. Binders use collections of files from Github repositories with instructions on software installation to create small (and free!) computing environments. They are used for teaching and demonstrating software functionality or analysis workflows.

Open the binder for this lesson in a **new tab** (i.e., by typing ++ctrl++ and clicking link): [Click me to launch binder!](https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/nih-cfde/training-rstudio-binder/conda-workshop-march2021?urlpath=rstudio){:target="_blank"}

It may take 3-4 minutes for the binder to load!

!!! info

    For this lesson, we are using Rstudio to teach you conda because it consolidates showing the conda commands, terminal, and file system all on 1 screen. In practice, you can use conda through a command-line terminal interface without Rstudio.

We are using 3 of the Rstudio panels for this lesson: Source panel to run conda commands, Terminal panel to execute code, and File panel to view input/output files. You can rearrange the panels to help with viewing:

!!! warning

    What happens if I get a 502, 503, or 504 error from the binder?

    Try clicking on the launch button again to re-launch. The binder or internet connection may have timed out.


Conda is already installed in the binder so the next step is to set it up. We'll talk more about [setting conda up](./install_conda_tutorial.md) on your local system later in the lesson!


### Initialize conda

To follow along, copy/paste commands into the terminal OR run the commands from the "workshop_commands.sh" file in the binder (in File Rstudio panel). Either click <span class="highlight_txt">Run</span> or type ++cmd+enter++ on Macs and ++ctrl+enter++ on Windows computers.

The conda installer sets up two things: Conda and the base environment (also called "root"). The base environment contains a version of python (specified during installation) and some basic packages. As illustrated below, you can then create additional environments with their own software installations, including other versions of the same software (i.e., python 3 in base environment and python 2.7 in a separate environment).

Setup the conda installer and initialize the settings:

```
conda init
```

The binder auto-generates a very long command prompt. We will shorten it to `$`:
```
echo "PS1='\w $ '" >> .bashrc
```

Re-start terminal for the changes to take effect (type `exit` and then open a new terminal).

We are currently in the `(base)` conda environment.

### Conda channels: Searching for software

The channels are places where conda looks for packages. The default channel after conda installation is set to Anaconda Inc's channels (Conda's Developer).

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1770401/sp/177040100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/29032722/partner_id/1770401?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_j2mmgrkh&flashvars[mediaProtocol]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerType]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerUrl]=rtmp://www.kaltura.com:1935&amp;flashvars[rtmpFlavors]=1&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_5max8sqt" width="608" height="402" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="Kaltura Player"></iframe>

```
conda config --show channels
conda list # get list of packages in base environment
```

!!! note

    You might notice that our installation of conda on the binder already had the `defaults` and `conda-forge` channels. This is due to the binder's set up. But in practice on your own system, it's important to add the channels as shown in this lesson.


Channels exist in a hierarchical order. By default, conda searches for packages based on:

**Channel priority > package version > package build number**

![](./conda-imgs/conda-channel.png 'conda channels')

Image credit: [Gergely Szerovay](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c/)

!!! info

    Commonly used channels:

    - In the absence of other channels, conda [searches the `defaults` repository](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/using-repositories/)
    - `conda-forge` and `bioconda` are channels that contain community-contributed software
    - `Bioconda` specializes in bioinformatics software
        - `Bioconda` *supports only 64-bit Linux and Mac OS*
        - [package list](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/repo)
    - `conda-forge` contains many dependency packages
        - [package list](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/repo)
    - You can even install R packages with conda!

We will update the channel list order and add `bioconda` since we are using bioinformatics tools today. **The order of the channels matters!**

First, add the `defaults` channel with the `conda config --add channels` command. We can check the channel priority order with the `conda config --get channels` command.

```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --get channels
```

Then add the `bioconda` channel:
```
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --get channels
```

Lastly, add the `conda-forge` channel to move it to top of the list, following [Bioconda's recommended channel order](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html#set-up-channels). This is because many packages on `bioconda` rely on dependencies that are available on `conda-forge`, so we want conda to search for those dependencies before trying to install any bioinformatics software.

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --get channels
```

With this configuration, conda will search for packages first in `conda-forge`, then `bioconda`, and then `defaults`.

!!! info

    Another way to add channels is:

    ```
    conda config --prepend channels bioconda
    ```

### Install Software and Create Environments

For our demo, we need to install [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), a commonly used software tool that provides quality control reports for raw sequencing data.

Search for software (fastqc):

=== "Input"

    ```
    conda search fastqc
    ```

=== "Expected Output"

    It may take a few seconds for the software list to display. The table shows all the versions and builds of fastqc available for installation with conda. They are all stored in the bioconda channel.

    ```
    Loading channels: done
    # Name                       Version           Build  Channel
    fastqc                        0.10.1               0  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.10.1               1  bioconda

    fastqc                        0.11.4               1  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.4               2  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.5               1  bioconda

    fastqc                        0.11.6               2  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.6      pl5.22.0_0  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.6      pl5.22.0_1  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.7               4  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.7               5  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.7               6  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.7      pl5.22.0_0  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.7      pl5.22.0_2  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.8               0  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.8               1  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.8               2  bioconda
    fastqc                        0.11.9               0  bioconda
    ```

Now, let's create a conda environment with fastqc installed in it.

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1770401/sp/177040100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/29032722/partner_id/1770401?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_d3lxef1n&flashvars[mediaProtocol]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerType]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerUrl]=rtmp://www.kaltura.com:1935&amp;flashvars[rtmpFlavors]=1&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_zf41375u" width="608" height="402" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="Kaltura Player"></iframe>

Create conda environment and install FastQC. This takes a few minutes (you'll see the message "Solving environment").

The `-y` flag tells conda not to ask you for confirmation about downloading software. The `--name` (or `-n`) flag specifies the environment's name. The last element of the command, `fastqc`, specifies the software package to install.

```
conda create -y --name fqc fastqc
```

More options to customize the environment are documented under the help page for this command: `conda create -h`.

The software you installed will only be available to use after you activate the environment:

```
conda activate fqc
```

This command shows you information about the activated conda environment:

```
conda info
```

One way to make sure the software works is to check the version:

```
fastqc --version
```

!!! info

    To go back to `(base) ~ $` environment:
    ```
    conda deactivate
    ```

High-throughput sequencing data quality control steps often involve FastQC and [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic). Trimmomatic is useful for read trimming (i.e., adapters). There are multiple ways we could create a conda environment that contains both software programs:

#### Method 1: install software in existing environment

We could add `trimmomatic` to the `fqc` environment:
```
conda install -y trimmomatic=0.36
conda list # check installed software
```

We can specify the exact software version with `=` and a version number. The default is to install the latest version, but sometimes your workflow may depend on an older version.

!!! info

    Software can also be installed by specifying the channel with `-c` flag:
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda trimmomatic=0.36
    ```

    or if needed, by specifying version *and* build (the default is to install the latest version and build):

    ```
    conda install trimmomatic=0.32=0
    ```

When you switch conda environments, conda changes the file path (and other environment variables) to searches for software packages in different folders.

Let's check the PATH for method 1:

=== "Input"

    ```
    echo $PATH
    ```

=== "Expected Output"

    You should see that the first element (`/srv/conda/envs/fqc/bin:`) in the file path changes each time you switch environments!

    ```
    /srv/conda/envs/fqc/bin:/srv/conda/condabin:/srv/conda/envs/notebook/bin:/srv/conda/condabin:/home/jovyan/.local/bin:/home/jovyan/.local/bin:/srv/conda/envs/notebook/bin:/srv/conda/bin:/srv/npm/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
    ```

#### Method 2: install both software during environment creation

For this method, we list `trimmomatic=0.36` after `fastqc` to create an environment with both installed, all with 1 command. Like above, remember to activate the environment and then you can check the list of packages to verify installation and check the PATH to verify that conda switched to the `fqc_trim` directory.

```
conda deactivate
conda create -y --name fqc_trim fastqc trimmomatic=0.36
conda activate fqc_trim
# check installed software
conda list
# path for method 2
echo $PATH
```

The following methods use an external file to specify the packages to install:

#### Method 3: specify software to install with a YAML file
Often, it's easier to create environments and install software using a YAML file that specifies all the software to be installed. For our example, we are using a file called `test.yml`.

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1770401/sp/177040100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/29032722/partner_id/1770401?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_stc3zu6d&flashvars[mediaProtocol]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerType]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerUrl]=rtmp://www.kaltura.com:1935&amp;flashvars[rtmpFlavors]=1&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_6n7tlxwg" width="608" height="402" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="Kaltura Player"></iframe>


Let's start back in the `(base)` environment.

```
conda deactivate
```

The `test.yml` file contains the following in YAML format:

=== "YAML"
```
name: qc_yaml #this specifies environment name
channels:
    - conda-forge
    - bioconda
    - defaults
dependencies:
    - fastqc
    - trimmomatic=0.36
```

!!! info

    [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a file format that is easy for both computers and humans to read. The YAML file extension is `.yml` and these files can be generated in any text editor.

    For conda, the `name:` is optional (it can also be specified in the `conda env create` command), but it must have a list of `channels:` and a list of `dependencies:`. Notice that the channels are list with highest to lowest priority.

Create the environment - note the difference in conda syntax. This method uses the `conda env create` command instead of `conda create`. The `-f` (or `--file`) flag specifies the file with the channels and software to set up.

```
# since environment name specified in yml file, we do not need to use -n flag here
conda env create -f test.yml
conda activate qc_yaml
# check installed software
conda list  
```

#### Method 4: Install exact environment

For this approach, we export a list of the exact software package versions installed in a given environment and use it to set up new environments. This set up method won't necessarily install the latest version of a given program, but it will replicate the exact environment set up you exported from.

```
conda activate fqc
conda list --export > packages.txt
conda deactivate
```

Two options -

1) install the exact package list into an existing environment:

```
conda install --file=packages.txt
```

OR

2) set up a new environment with the exact package list:

```
conda env create --name qc_file -f packages.txt
```

### Managing Environments

At this point, we have several conda environments! To see a list:
```
conda env list
```

The current environment you're in is marked with an asterisk `*`.

!!! note

    There are a few redundant commands in conda. For example, this command does exactly the same thing as the one above:

    ```
    conda info --envs
    ```

Generally, you want to avoid installing too many software packages in one environment. The more software you install, the longer it takes for conda to resolve compatible software versions for an environment (it'll take longer and longer at the "Solving environment" stage).

For this reason, and in practice, people often manage software for their workflows with multiple conda environments.

### Running FastQC in a conda environment

Let's run a small analysis with FastQC in the `fqc` environment we created above.

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1770401/sp/177040100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/29032722/partner_id/1770401?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_v9ijwu6g&flashvars[mediaProtocol]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerType]=rtmp&amp;flashvars[streamerUrl]=rtmp://www.kaltura.com:1935&amp;flashvars[rtmpFlavors]=1&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_672rs9xp" width="608" height="402" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="Kaltura Player"></iframe>

If not already done, activate one of the environments we created, e.g.,:

```
conda activate fqc
```

Let's make sure the software was installed correctly by looking at the help documentation:

=== "Input"

    ```
    fastqc --help
    ```

=== "Expected Output"

    Output should look like:
    ```
    FastQC - A high throughput sequence QC analysis tool

    SYNOPSIS

        fastqc seqfile1 seqfile2 .. seqfileN

        fastqc [-o output dir] [--(no)extract] [-f fastq|bam|sam]
           [-c contaminant file] seqfile1 .. seqfileN
    ...
    ```


Download data (a yeast sequence file):

```
curl -L https://osf.io/5daup/download -o ERR458493.fastq.gz
```

Check out the data:

=== "Input"

    The `gunzip -c` command allows us to see the unzipped version of the file without actually unzipping it (you can verify this by checking the file extension after running this command!). The `|` is called a pipe and it takes the output of the `gunzip -c` command and hands it to the `wc` word count command. The `-l` flag tells `wc` we want to count the number of lines in the file.

    ```
    gunzip -c ERR458493.fastq.gz | wc -l
    ```

=== "Expected Output"

    There should be 4,375,828 lines in the file.

What does the fastq file look like?

=== "Input"

    Here are two ways to look at the sequence read file:

    1\. Use the `gunzip -c` and pipe the output to the `head` command to show the first 10 lines of the file:

    ```
    gunzip -c ERR458493.fastq.gz | head
    ```

    2\. Use the `less` command to scroll through the file:

    ```
    less ERR458493.fastq.gz
    ```


=== "Expected Output"

    The beginning of the fastq format sequence file should look like this, where the 1st line is the sequence read ID (starts with `@`), the 2nd line is the DNA sequence, the 3rd is sequence separator `+`, and the 4th is the Phred quality score associated with each base pair in ASCII format.
