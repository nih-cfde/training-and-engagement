An Introduction to R for RNA-Sequencing Analysis
================================================

RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a popular method for
determining the presence and quantity of RNA in biological samples. In
this 3 hour workshop, we will use R to explore publicly-available
RNA-Seq data from the [Gene Expression Tissue Project
(GTEx)](https://gtexportal.org/home/). Attendees will be introduced to
the R syntax, variables, functions, packages, and data structures common
to RNA-Seq projects. We will use RStudio to import, tidy, transform, and
visualize RNA-Seq count data. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for
making the processes of data wrangling and data harmonization more
manageable. This workshop will not cover cloud-based workflows for
processing RNA-seq reads or statistics and modeling because these topics
are covered in our [RNA-Seq Concepts](https://osf.io/kj5av/) and
[RNA-Seq in the
Cloud](https://github.com/nih-cfde/rnaseq-in-the-cloud/blob/stable/rnaseq-workflow.pdf)
workshops. Rather, this workshop will focus on general R concepts
applied to RNA-Seq data. 

| Lesson name | Length |
| --- | --- | 
| [Introduction](./intro.md) | 25 min |
| [Import Data](./import.md) | 30 min |
| [Visualize Data](./visualize.md) | 30 min |

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

    In this workshop, you will learn how to use R and RStudio to:
      - import and view files commonly associated with RNA-sequencing experiments
      - select variables and observations that are relevant to research questions (tidy)
      - create and rename variables (transform)
      - join data frames by common variables (harmonize)
      - visualize data using bar graphs, scatter plots, and box plots

=== "Prerequisites"

    Familiarity with R and RNA Sequencing is not required but would be useful.

=== "Tutorial Resources"

    Please refer to the [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for commonly used R functions!
