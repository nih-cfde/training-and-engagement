An Introduction to R For RNA-Sequencing Analysis
================================================

RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a popular method for
determining the presence and quantity of RNA in biological samples. In
this 3 hour workshop, we will use R to explore publicly-available
RNA-Seq data from the [Gene Expression Tissue Project
(GTEx)](https://gtexportal.org/home/). Attendees will be introduced to
the R syntax, variables, functions, packages, and data structures common
to RNA-Seq projects. We will use RStudio to import, tidy, transform, and
visualize RNA-Seq count data. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for
making the processes of data wrangling and data harmonization more
manageable. This workshop will not cover cloud-based workflows for
processing RNA-seq reads or statistics and modeling because these topics
are covered in our [RNA-Seq Concepts](https://osf.io/kj5av/) and
[RNA-Seq in the
Cloud](https://github.com/nih-cfde/rnaseq-in-the-cloud/blob/stable/rnaseq-workflow.pdf)
workshops. Rather, this workshop will focus on general R concepts
applied to RNA-Seq data.

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

In this workshop, you will learn how to use R and RStudio to:

-   import and view files commonly associated with RNA-sequencing
    experiments
-   select variables and observations that are relevant to research
    questions (tidy)
-   create and rename variables (transform)
-   join data frames by common variables (harmonize)
-   visualize data using bar graphs, scatter plots, and box plots


=== "Prerequisites"

Familiarity with R and RNA Sequencing is not required but would be
useful.

=== "Tutorial Resources"

Please refer to the [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for commonly used R functions!
