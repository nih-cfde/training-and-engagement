An Introduction to UNIX for Cloud Computing
============================================

This tutorial introduces the UNIX command line. It is designed for scientists and clinicians who need to use cloud-based and remote computers for basic and biomedical research.

!!! note Learning Objectives

	The objectives of this tutorial are to:

	* Understand basic UNIX command structure 
	* Navigate through hierarchical directory structures
	* Read, write, create, copy, move, and remove files
	* Understand wildcard expression 
	* Combine commands into workflows

The lesson materials were adapted from the UC Davis Data Lab's [Intro to Cloud Computing](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/) workshop, Data Carpentry's [Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/) lesson, and the Lab for Data Intensive Biology's [Advanced Beginner/Intermediate Shell](https://dib-training.readthedocs.io/en/pub/2016-01-13-adv-beg-shell.html) workshop. Today's workshop is designed to prepare you for taking subsequent cloud computing and bioinformatic workshops.
