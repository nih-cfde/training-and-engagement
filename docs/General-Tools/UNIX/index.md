An Introduction to UNIX for Cloud Computing 
================================================

This lesson introduces the UNIX command line to scientists and clinicians who need to use cloud-based and remote computers for basic and biomedical research. The commands used in today's workshop are commonly used by practitioners across disciplines. By practicing the commands, you will gain familiarity with the command line and confidence as a programmer. These commands can be used on a local or remote computer. We hope that you notice an improvement in the speed and reproducibility of your bioinformatics workflow.

=== "Tutorial resources" 

   The lesson materials were adapted from the UC Davis Data Lab's [Intro to Cloud Computing](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2021-august-remote-computing/) workshop, Data Carpentry's [Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/) lesson, and the Lab for Data Intensive Biology's [Advanced Beginner/Intermediate Shell](https://dib-training.readthedocs.io/en/pub/2016-01-13-adv-beg-shell.html) workshop. 
   Please refer to our [UNIX Cheatsheet](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/General-Tools/Cheat-Sheets/bash_cheatsheet/) for a list of commonly used commands.  The website [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/) succinctly explains shell commands and arguments. 


=== "Prerequisites"

   The UNIX lesson uses a standardized binder environment, which will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and Firefox, Safari, and Chrome web browsers.
