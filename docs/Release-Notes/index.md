# Latest Release

**Updated February 15, 2022**

## Updates

- Added a new lesson called [Incorporating GTEx Data in Kids First Analyses](../Bioinformatic-Analyses/RNAseq-on-Cavatica/rna_seq_9.md). This lesson demonstrates how to identify GTEx Datasets from the AnVIL Portal and import them into the CAVATICA/Kids First environment. It builds on the existing RNA-Seq training documentation by providing directions for expanding analyses to include GTEx's data as a source of RNA-Seq controls to compare to Kids First tumor samples. It also demonstrates interoperability between two of CFDE's DCCs.

- Added a new page with a dozen [video tutorials for Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG)](../Common-Fund-Tools/IDG.md). The tools derived from the IDG program provide either user-friendly visualizations or ways to impute knowledge about potential targets using machine learning strategies. Watch these videos for step-by-step descriptions on how to use each web-based tool to accelerate illumination in under-studied proteins.

- Updated the list of past events on the [homepage](./index.md) to include the recent workshop series covering UNIX and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Cloud Computing.
