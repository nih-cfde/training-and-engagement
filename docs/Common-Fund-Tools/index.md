# Common Fund Tools

## CFDE Search Portal

The [NIH Common Fund (CF)](https://commonfund.nih.gov) has funded a wide variety of data types and studies that are of interest to clinical and biomedical researchers, however those datasets are hosted on an equally large number of websites, with varying query systems. The [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org) is a unified system for searching across the entire CF portfolio in a single search, and is the first step in addressing the goal of making CF data more [Find-able, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)](https://www.nih-cfde.org/product/fair-cookbook/). The wide range of data types, models and formats used by Common Fund Programs are being harmonized using well-defined metadata, common controlled vocabularies using the [Crosscut Metadata Model](https://www.nih-cfde.org/product/cfde-c2m2/).

## Kids First & CAVATICA Lessons

The [NIH Common Fund-supported Gabriella Miller Kids First (KF) Data Resource
Center (DRC)](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) enables researchers, clinicians, and
patients to work together to accelerate research and promote new
discoveries for children affected with cancer and structural birth
defects. Data from over 16,000 individuals, including DNA and RNA sequence data, is
available to empower your research today. Data collected from more than
30,000 samples are expected to be available in the next few years.

Our aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for
working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with
less pain. The goal of this training module is to enable clinicians and
researchers to use the data portal to build cohorts, and to move that data to an analysis platform ([CAVATICA](https://cavatica.squarespace.com/)).

=== "Prerequisites"

     This training assumes a basic background in human medicine. For this tutorial, you'll need a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). You'll also need 1) either ORCID or Google account and 2) eRA Commons ID credentials to login and connect portals.

## IDG Tutorials

Members of Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Common Fund Program have created [video tutorials](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/Common-Fund-Tools/IDG/) for a variety of IDG tools and resources.
