# Overview

The [NIH Common Fund (CF)](https://commonfund.nih.gov) has funded a wide variety of data types and studies that are of interest to clinical and biomedical researchers, however those datasets are hosted on an equally large number of websites, with varying query systems. The [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org) is a unified system for searching across the entire CF portfolio in a single search, and is the first step in addressing the goal of making CF data more [Find-able, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)](https://www.nih-cfde.org/product/fair-cookbook/). The wide range of data types, models and formats used by Common Fund Programs are being harmonized using well-defined metadata, common controlled vocabularies using the [Crosscut Metadata Model](https://www.nih-cfde.org/product/cfde-c2m2/).

The [CFDE Search Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) uses the Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2) a flexible metadata standard for describing experimental resources in biomedicine and related fields. This portal supports faceted search of metadata concepts such as anatomical location, species, and assay type, across a wide variety of datasets using a controlled vocabulary (we do not currently support protected metadata). This allows researchers to find a wide variety of data that would otherwise need to be searched individually, using varying nomenclatures. The portal only accepts C2M2 data packages from Common Fund Programs.

This tutorial focuses on the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). The goal of this tutorial is to identify small FASTQ files with persistent identifiers from a longitudinal multi-comics study.
