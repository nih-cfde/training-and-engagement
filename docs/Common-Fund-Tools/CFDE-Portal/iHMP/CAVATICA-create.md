## Step 3: Choose your login system

You should now have the option to continue using an eRA Commons ID, or
by setting up a user name and password.

-   If you have an eRA Commons ID, choose "login with with eRA
    Commons" and log in using your credentials.
-   If you don't have an eRA Commons ID, choose "Continue with email
    and password" and then fill out the form and click
    "Register".

!!! Important

    While you will be able to explore data in the Cavatica regardless of
    which mechanism you choose, moving data from Kids First and doing
    research requires that you have the proper authorization to view and use
    human data, even if that data is officially "open". If you have one,
    you should opt to login using your eRA Commons ID.


## Step 5: Click the email link

Once your registration is complete, you should get a prompt to go check
your email:
