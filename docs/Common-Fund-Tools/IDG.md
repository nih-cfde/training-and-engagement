# Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Tutorials

![](../images/IDG_Logo.png)

The NIH funded the [Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG)](https://druggablegenome.net/) program to improve our understanding of the properties and functions of proteins that are currently under-annotated within the three most commonly drug-targeted protein families: G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels, and protein kinases. 

Since 2014, the IDG Knowledge Management Center (IDG-KMC) has generated several open-access datasets and resources that jointly serve as a highly translational machine-learning-ready knowledgebases focused on human protein-coding genes and their products. The goal of the IDG-KMC is to develop comprehensive integrated knowledge for the druggable genome to illuminate the uncharacterized or poorly annotated portion of the druggable genome. 

The tools derived from the IDG-KMC provide either user-friendly visualizations or ways to impute knowledge about potential targets using machine learning strategies. For step-by-step descriptions on how to use each web-based tool to accelerate illumination in under-studied proteins check out our [Current Protocols doi: 10.1002/cpz1.355](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.355).

Here, we provide links to and descriptions of some recent video tutorials and presentations on IDG tools and resources. You can also subscribe to the [IDG YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DruggableGenomeIDG/videos) to stay up-to-date on new topics.
