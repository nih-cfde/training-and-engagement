## Release Checklist

A series of checklists will be implemented to ensure error free working tutorials are released to the public.

Individual tutorials will follow the formatting, organization, and layout details described in the [training website style guide](https://hackmd.io/Znxo_eOBQsaxszl_Uduk5A?view#Contributing-to-the-nih-cfde-Training-and-Engagement-website).

The PR author should ensure:
- [ ] Clean build logs
- [ ] Colorblindness test https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/
- [ ] Correct rendering of website (preview of their branch using autogenerated RTD link)
- [ ] Resolution of any conflicts
- [ ] Release label
- [ ] PR type label
- [ ] Assignment to the appropriate project
- [ ] Linking of related issues


Following the PR to merge into `dev`, the reviewers must ensure the tutorials pass the checklist for:
- [ ] spelling and grammar
- [ ] successful run of all installation and code chunks
- [ ] sufficient explanation and details for the tutorial content
- [ ] code syntax and naming convention
- [ ] adherence of tutorial format to style guide
- [ ] functional links (inter and intra)
- [ ] accessible hyperlink text

### Review process

The overall workflow is visualized in the flow diagram of the review process.

![Training review process](../images/Training_review_process.png)

The review process is split between the two levels of merge. Individual branches get merged into `dev` and
all the changes for a release are collectively merged from `dev` into `stable` which is the base for the public facing website.

Merge into `dev` from individual branch requires two reviews while merge into `stable` requires group approval. Currently,
automated reviewer assignment has been implemented which assigns the correct number of reviewers depending on the merging branch. However,
in scenario where the team member with experience in a tutorial topic is not assigned to review the tutorials, one can manually add an
additional reviewer. Alternatively, that team member can offer their review in form of comments on the PR.

## Release Cycle

Each Release cycle will be defined as the time period between the releases. The release cycle will have some set phases:
- tracking
- planning
- development
- internal release deadline
- final merge
- public release

### Tracking

Using 'Projects' in GitHub we will create and track issues throughout the release cycle.

### Planning

Each release cycle there are different tasks to be completed:
- New tutorial development
- Fixes to existing tutorials
- GitHub management - creating issues and labels - tracking
- New tutorial reviews
- General reviews
- Reviews for merge into `stable`
- Release note maintenance

The planning phase scheduled following a release will allow for discussion and assignment of the different roles for the upcoming release. This phase will also include discussion for generating new content and creation of appropriate issues in the training repo. 

### Development

This phase will include work on developing new content and enhancing published tutorials.

- It is recommended that the authors developing new tutorials provide at least 1 week for the review process when the tutorial is ready.
- When possible include installation and setup steps across all target platforms (Mac, linux, Windows)
    - Provide links to setup instructions if it already exists as standalone tutorials
    - For overlapping setup instructions that are part of an existing tutorial, check if the setup instructions can be reorganized
      into standalone modules if not already in that format.
- To ensure tracking and linking of related issues, the authors involved in tutorial creation or fixes
  should create related issues in the training-and-engagement GitHub repo and assign appropriate labels for the release.

### Internal release deadline

Internal Release Deadline: five business/working days prior to release date
This phase will involve finalizing release-notes for the website. A draft of the release notes will be auto generated based on PR merges into `dev`. The edited draft will be release both on the training GitHub repo as well as in a new tab on the website with links in the landing page.

   - All PRs tagged for the upcoming release start preparation for successful merge into `dev` and successfully rendered.
   - The original PR author should ensure all review comments (if any) are addressed prior to merge.
   - All new tutorials should follow the style guide for formatting and tutorial arrangement.
   - If changes requested from a reviewer on a PR cannot be completed by the internal release deadline, the PR author
     should relabel with the next release date.
   - Connect intra tutorials that were merged into `dev` if applicable
   - Release notes are modified and merged.

### Final merge

This phase will involve merging `dev` into `stable`. Allotted timeline would be 5 business/working days until release date. Merging from `dev` to `stable` requires group approval. For this phase, one PR will be opened for merge into `stable` and the approval for merge will be based on the rendered website with the following checklist:

   -  If new features were merged check for functionality across entire site
   -  Check the format and rendering of release-notes on website
   -  Check for tutorial rendering on multiple browsers, modes (normal, incognito) and devices (phone, tablet, laptop)
        - [ ] Chrome
        - [ ] Safari
        - [ ] Edge
        - [ ] Firefox


### Public release

After the creation of release notes and the successful merge of `dev` into `stable` we will announce the release on GitHub, Twitter, the website, and through the CFDE Newsletter.

## Release Documentation

The Github repo for the training website will host a release section and associated tag information.

The release information will be documented in a markdown file `release-notes.md` and hosted within `release-notes` folder in the Github repo.

The release notes announcing `What's new ?` will also be highlighted on the training website. The website version will include a summarized version of the GitHub release notes.

Suggested format:

 > Release Version
 >
 > What's New?
 >
 > Links to new tutorials added in the current release
 >
 > Improvements or Enhancements
 >
 > Any enhancements to tutorials or website features. This would include any additional screencasts, vidlets,
 images that were added to tutorials and integrated website features
 >
 > Fixes
 >
 > This section will highlight any code or link fixes to existing tutorials in addition to any clarification notes and explanation
 that was added.

For documentation version numbering system we will follow the release date convention. Thus our release tag would have the
format: **`YYYY.MM`**

The upcoming release would have the tag **`2020.10`** to signify October, 2020 release.

This would follow the same convention as set for labels on GitHub repo.
