Exploring Data in the Portal
=============================


Now that all of our accounts are interconnected, let's actually explore the data.

What data is here?
=============================

The data at the Kids First DRC is from children with
childhood cancer and structural birth defects or their family members.
As of early 2020, the Kids First DRC maintains Whole Genome Sequences (WGS)
and/or RNAseq data for over 12,000 individuals. However, Kids First doesn't only
host data about DNA and RNA. Using the portal you can access a wide range of
data types including Histology Images, Pathology Reports, Radiology Images,
Radiology Reports, Operation Reports, Annotated Somatic Mutations, Gene Fusions,
Gene Expression, Somatic Copy Number Variations, and Isoform Expression.

Exploring the Data
=============================

It is important to get a sense of what data exists before we start filtering
down and designing an experiment. This page gives us a set of six interactive plots
that display the overall data. You can impose filters on the data in two different
ways:

* By using the filter buttons
* By clicking a graph component of any plot
