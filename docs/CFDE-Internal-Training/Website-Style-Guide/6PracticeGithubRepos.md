# Practice Github repo style guide

Some of the tutorials in the "General Tutorials" section link to a practice repo that is used as starting guide. For any new tutorial that requires setting a practice repo as a start point, the following guidelines can be used:

- Create a new public repo in the [nih-cfde organization](https://github.com/nih-cfde/). The name should start with "training-" and include the tutorial or tool 
- Add a README that describes the repo and link to associated tutorial on the `stable` branch.
- Add the repo to the tutorial as a hyperlink.
- Download/`git clone` the repo and test the tutorial.
