An Introduction to Conda
============================================

Conda is a very helpful tool for easily installing, managing, and reproducing software environments used in computational workflows, such as high-throughput sequence data processing or downstream data visualization workflows to name a few!

At the end of the lesson, we'll also briefly discuss other useful applications of conda and setting up conda on your own system.

Est. Time | Lesson name | Description
--- | --- | ---
10 mins | [Introduction](./conda1.md) | What is conda?
1 hr | [Using conda environments](./conda2.md) | How to use conda to install software with isolated environments?
30 mins | [Conda exercises](./conda3.md) | Practice creating conda environments
5 mins | [What else can we use conda for?](./conda4.md) | Other applications for conda
20 mins | [Setting up conda on your computer](install_conda_tutorial.md) | Considerations for installing conda

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

    - Learn about conda and how to use it
    - Learn the basics of software installation, software dependencies, and isolation environments
    - Learn about managing virtual environments
    - Install Miniconda
    - Set up a conda environment

=== "Prerequisites"

    The conda lesson uses a standardized binder environment, which will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and Firefox, Safari, and Chrome web browsers.

    The installation tutorial is currently written specifically for installing the MacOS version of Miniconda.

=== "Tutorial Resources"

    Please refer to [our conda command cheat sheet](../../Cheat-Sheets/conda_cheatsheet.md) and the [official conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html) for commonly used conda commands!
