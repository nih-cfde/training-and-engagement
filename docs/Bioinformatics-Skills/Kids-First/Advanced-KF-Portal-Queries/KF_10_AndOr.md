ANDs and ORs
===============================

![Multiple Filters](../images-kf/KidsFirstPortal_20.png "Multiple Filters")

Note that all of your filters are automatically connected by "AND"s,
but that might not always be what you want. If I wanted to see the
participants that meet at least one of my filters, but not all of them,
I can click on an "AND" and change it to "OR", which dramatically
changes my results:

![AND Filters](../images-kf/KidsFirstPortal_21.png "AND Filters")

![OR Filters](../images-kf/KidsFirstPortal_22.png "OR Filters")

Note that when you change one AND/OR selection, it changes *all* of the
AND/OR boxes in that query line.
