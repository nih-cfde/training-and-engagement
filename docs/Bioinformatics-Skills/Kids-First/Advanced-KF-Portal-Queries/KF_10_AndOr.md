ANDs and ORs
===============================

![Multiple Filters](../images-kf/KidsFirstPortal_23.png "Multiple Filters")

All of your filters are automatically connected by "AND"s,
but that might not always be what you want.

If you wanted to view a list of participants that meet at least one, but not all of the filters,
you can click on an "AND" and change it to an "OR", which dramatically
changes the results of the search:

!!! Note
    When you change one AND/OR selection, it changes *all* of the
    AND/OR boxes in that query line.
