Exploring Data in the Portal
============================

Now that all of our accounts are interconnected, let's actually explore
the data.

What data is here?
------------------

The data at the Kids First DRC is from children with childhood cancer
and structural birth defects or their family members. As of end of 2020,
the Kids First DRC maintains Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) and/or RNAseq
data for over 16,000 individuals. However, data available on the Kids First Portal
is not restricted to information about DNA and RNA. Using the portal you can access a
wide range of data types including Histology Images, Pathology Reports, Radiology
Images, Radiology Reports, Operation Reports, Annotated Somatic
Mutations, Gene Fusions, Gene Expression, Somatic Copy Number
Variations, and Isoform Expression.

### Step 1: Get logged in to the Kids First DRC Portal

If you aren't still logged in to the Kids First Portal, navigate to
<https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/> and use the credentials you set up
previously in this lesson to log in.

 When you first log in, you will see
this screen:

Exploring the Data
------------------

It is important to get a sense of what data exists before we start
filtering down and designing an experiment. This page gives us a set of
seven interactive plots that display the overall data. You can impose
filters on the data in two different ways:

-   By using the filter buttons
-   By clicking a graph component of any plot

!!! Note

    Application of the filters via the graph of any plot allows for choice of one value. In case of values spanning multiple bars in a plot,
    it is recommended to use the filter buttons.
