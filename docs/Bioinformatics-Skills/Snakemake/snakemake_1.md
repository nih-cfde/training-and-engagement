# Set Up

## Choose computing environment

There are two ways to follow this tutorial:

**A) Use the pangeo binder.** This is a good option if you don't have access to a Unix/Linux computer.

- Open the binder environment with the "Launch binder" button below in a **new tab**. It will take a few minutes to build:

    [![Binder](https://binder.pangeo.io/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/nih-cfde/training-snakemake-binder/stable-binder)

- Click on the "Terminal" button to launch it:

    ![binder terminal button](./images-snakemake/snakemake_binder_terminal.png "binder terminal button")

- Then, follow the set up instructions below starting at **step 2**. The Snakefile and necessary conda environment files are already installed in the binder.

!!! warning
    When you close the binder, it does NOT save your work so download any files you want to keep.

- To download files, right-click the file you want to save, and select "Download":

    ![binder download button](./images-snakemake/snakemake_binder_download.png "binder download button")

- To close the binder, go to "File" and click "Shut Down":

    ![shut down binder button](./images-snakemake/snakemake_binder_close.png "shut down binder button")

**B) Use a Unix or Linux environment (e.g., with a Mac or High Performing Computing environment).**

- For this option, please follow **all** the set up instructions below.

## Set up computing environment

We will use conda to create an computer software for this tutorial. If you don't have conda installed, please see the [Set up computing environment with conda on MacOS tutorial](../install_conda_tutorial.md).

!!! Tip

    Please refer to the [conda command cheat sheet](../../Cheat-Sheets/conda_cheatsheet.md) for commonly used conda commands!

### Step 1: Download tutorial files:

First, create a new directory for this tutorial in the `(base)` conda environment, e.g.,:

```
mkdir learn_snakemake
```

We need two files for this tutorial. Click the links and save them in the directory you created above: 1) [environment.yml](./snakemake_tutorial_docs/environment.yml) and 2) [Snakefile](./snakemake_tutorial_docs/Snakefile.py).

Rename the "Snakefile.py" to "Snakefile". There should be no file extension (we just added it so you'd be able to download the file!).

### Step 2: Create new conda environment:

The "environment.yml" file tells conda 1) where to look for the software installations under "channels" and 2) what software to install under "dependencies". You can also specify specific software versions, otherwise conda will download the most up-to-date version. Here are the specifications we'll use for this tutorial:

channels:

  - conda-forge
  - bioconda
  - defaults

dependencies:

  - bwa
  - snakemake-minimal=5.8.1
  - samtools=1.10
  - bcftools

Create a new environment called `snaketest` from the `(base)` environment:
```
conda env create -n snaketest -f environment.yml
```

Use this command if you are running the pangeo binder:
```
conda env create -n snaketest -f ./binder/environment.yml
```

### Step 3: Activate conda environment:

```
conda activate snaketest
```

Note that your terminal command prompt should now look like `(snaketest) $` instead of `(base) $`.

### Step 4: Test that your environment is ready to go

You should have several software installed in your `snaketest` environment now. Check it out!

=== "Input"

    ```
    samtools --version
    ```

=== "Expected Output"

    ```
    samtools 1.10
    Using htslib 1.10.2

    ```

If you get an error, the software installation may have failed. You can check the software that is installed in your conda environment: `conda list`

To leave the conda environment, type: `conda deactivate`

Later in the tutorial, we'll use `wget` to download data. Installing `wget` on MacOS can be achieved with `conda install`. This step will take a few minutes and the installation should be done in the `base` conda environment:

Go back to base environment:
```
conda deactivate
```

Install `wget`:
```
conda install -c anaconda wget
```

Test installation:

=== "Input"

    ```
    wget --version
    ```

=== "Expected Output"

    ```
    GNU Wget 1.20.1 built on darwin14.5.0.
