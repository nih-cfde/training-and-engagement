title: CFDE Portal Overview

**CFDE Portal Use Cases**

The [NIH Common Fund (CF)](https://commonfund.nih.gov) has funded a wide variety of data types and studies that are of interest to clinical and biomedical researchers, however those datasets are hosted on an equally large number of websites, with varying query systems. The [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org) is a unified system for searching across the entire CF portfolio in a single search, and is the first step in addressing the goal of making CF data more [Find-able, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)](https://www.nih-cfde.org/product/fair-cookbook/). The wide range of data types, models and formats used by Common Fund Programs are being harmonized using well-defined metadata, common controlled vocabularies using the [Crosscut Metadata Model](https://www.nih-cfde.org/product/cfde-c2m2/).

By following these tutorials researchers and clinicians will learn to navigate within the [CFDE Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org). Users will learn how to use this portal to find datasets from many different CF Programs in a single search to build a cohort, and to save that cohort as a single metadata manifest file. Users will also learn to use the information in the manifest to gather the associated data files from their originating CF data portals. While some discoverable datasets may be public-access, many are likely to be controlled-access.

**Use Case 1: Gathering Blood Cancer Datasets**  

Est. Time | Lesson name | Description
--- | --- | ---
10 mins | [Cohort Selection for Blood Cancer](./Blood-Cancer/blood-cancer-portal-export.md) | Identify RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets in CFDE portal
15 mins | [Blood Datasets from CF Program Portals](./Blood-Cancer/blood-cancer-data-access.md) | Access identified cohort in individual CF data portals

**Use Case 2: Compiling Datasets of Movement-Related Disorders**

Est. Time | Lesson name | Description
--- | --- | ---
10 mins | [Multi-omics Data Discovery for Movement-Related Disorders](./Movement-Related-Disorders/movement-disorders-portal-export.md) | Identify multiomics datasets
10 mins | [Movement Disorders Datasets in CF Program Portals](./Movement-Related-Disorders/movement-disorders-data-access.md) | Access identified datasets in individual CF data portals
