**CFDE Portal Use Cases**

The [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org) is the first step in addressing the goal of making NIH Common Fund (CF) data Find-able, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) both within and between CF programs. The wide range of data types, models and formats are harmonized using well-defined metadata, common controlled vocabularies using the [Crosscut Metadata Model](https://cfde-published-documentation.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).

Here, we explore two disparate use cases to showcase the potential of the CFDE portal in accelerating discovery and novel scientific research. Each use case is divided into two sections. The first half details the steps to identify and obtain the metadata manifest from the [CFDE portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org). The second half focuses on steps to gather the associated data files from their originating CF data portals using the information in the metadata manifest. While some datasets may be public-access, many are likely to be controlled-access. For tutorial cohort that includes controlled-access data, we also show how a researcher would apply for access to protected data.
