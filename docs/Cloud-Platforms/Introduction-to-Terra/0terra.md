# How does Terra work?

In a nutshell, Terra provides you a consolidated, shareable space for data storage, analysis workflows, and analysis outputs. When you submit a workflow job or use interactive coding tools (Jupyter notebooks, Rstudio), Terra does the heavy-lifting of managing the computational resources for your analysis.

The underlying cloud computing services are provided by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - primarily the Compute Engine and Storage Bucket services. For an introduction to the GCP, see our [tutorial](../Introduction-to-GCP/index.md) on setting up a GCP virtual machine.

## Why use Terra?

Terra may be the cloud platform for you if:

- You do not have (long-term) access to a high performance computer (HPC)
- You have HPC access, but you want to avoid long queues to start/complete jobs
- You have large datasets that need to be processed in the same way and you want scale up with cloud services
- You want to use cloud services that provide an interactive web-based user interface
- You want to use or customize existing analysis workflows on the Terra platform
- You need a secure place to share and track versions of data/workflows with collaborators. Terra was designed to meet the security standards required for using and storing human data for biomedical research.
- You want to use data that is only available from a Terra workspace (e.g., Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project [controlled-access data](https://anvilproject.org/data?query=consortium%3DGTEx%2B%2528v8%2529))
- You want to share your datasets or workflows with the research community on Terra


## Finding help on Terra

The [support center](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us) and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkXAqpR5Hk1ZmNd2-1K2l5Q/videos) of short tutorial videos provide helpful documentation for all users looking to get started with Terraâ€™s basic functions. Importantly, both are actively updated, so users can be sure they are getting the most up-to-date information. Once you've set up an account, you can also post questions to the [community help forum](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/community/topics) or directly to Terra by [submitting a request](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/requests/new). There is a [service notification page](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/sections/360003692231-Service-Notifications) for scheduled maintenance or service interruptions/errors related to the Terra platform.
