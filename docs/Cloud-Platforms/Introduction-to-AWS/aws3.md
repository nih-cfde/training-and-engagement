title: Using the Screen Command
---

Screen or GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer. You can start a terminal session and then open multiple screens inside that session. Processes running in Screen will continue to run when their window is not visible, even if your session gets disconnected/times out - you can even close the terminal/connection to AWS instance and commands running on screens will continue!

The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to run and switch between multiple screen sessions. Check out the [screen cheat sheet](../../General-Tools/Cheat-Sheets/screen_cheatsheet.md){:target="_blank"} for commonly used commands.

## Installing the Screen

To install screen, run the following command:

=== "AWS Instance Code"
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install screen
    ```

=== "Expected Output"
    ```
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-7-6:~$ sudo apt-get install screen
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    screen is already the newest version (4.8.0-1).
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 7 not upgraded.
    ```

The first line of code updates your instance to all latest software configurations. The second line of code does the actual installing.

## Running Screen

To help tell the different terminal screens apart, type this command on the original terminal window (before you try out `screen`):

=== "AWS Instance Code"

    ```
    echo "this is the original terminal window"
    ```

!!! Warning
    Do not clear the screen. We want to make sure the "this is the original terminal window" text lingers when we toggle back to this window later.

    This message may not be visible in the AWS browser terminal.


Then, type the following into the same AWS instance to start a new screen session.

=== "AWS Instance Code"
    ```
    screen
    ```
=== "Expected Output"
    ```

    ```
Press ++space++ (twice) or ++return++ to get to the command prompt. You are now on a new screen!

!!! Note
    If you plan to work with multiple screens, it helps to give each screen a unique name to tell them apart. You can name your screen by adding the `-S` flag and a name:
    ```
    screen -S <name>
    ```

## Using screen

Let's run a program in the new screen window to test it out:

=== "AWS Instance Code"
    ```
    top
    ```
The `top` command is used to show the Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system. Usually, this command shows the summary information of the system and the list of processes or threads which are currently managed by the Linux Kernel.

While the top command is still running, create a screen tab by clicking ++ctrl+a+c++. You should see a new blank terminal.

Let's run a command in this blank terminal:

=== "AWS Instance Code"
    ```
    ping google.com
    ```
=== "Expected Output"
    ```
    PING google.com (172.217.4.206) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from ord37s19-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.4.206): icmp_seq=1 ttl=100 time=17.4 ms
    64 bytes from ord37s19-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.4.206): icmp_seq=2 ttl=100 time=17.4 ms
    64 bytes from ord37s19-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.4.206): icmp_seq=3 ttl=100 time=17.5 ms
    64 bytes from ord37s19-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.4.206): icmp_seq=4 ttl=100 time=17.5 ms
    .....
    ```

A ping test is a method of checking if the computer is connected to a network. It is used to ensure that a host computer which your computer tries to access is operating. It is run for troubleshooting to know connectivity as well as response time.

Now, we have three running "screens":

- Screen 1) The original ssh terminal you saw at login. You typed the `echo` command in it.
- Screen 2) A screen that's running the `top` command.
- Screen 3) A screen that's running the `ping google.com` command.

!!! tip

    Think of the first screen command entered into your original terminal like opening a new browser window (i.e., our screen 2).

    - After starting a screen, you can open multiple tabs within the same window using ++ctrl+a+c++ (i.e., our screen 3).

    - You can toggle between the multiple tabs using ++ctrl+a+p++. You can have commands running in each tab.

    - Detaching the screen allows you to go back to the original window/panel.

    - If you start another screen from the original terminal window, it would be like opening another browser window, instead of adding a tab to an existing window.

### Switching between tabs

 To switch between the two new tabs, i.e., our screen 2 and screen 3, type ++ctrl+a+p++. You cannot toggle to the original terminal screen (i.e. screen 1) with this shortcut.

### Detaching screens

 To detach a screen session and return to your original SSH terminal, type ++ctrl+a+d++. You will be taken back to the terminal window with the `echo` command:

![](./images-aws/original_ssh_terminal.png)

To list your current screen sessions type:

=== "AWS Instance Code"
    ```
    screen -ls
    ```

=== "Expected Output"
    ```
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-7-6:~$ screen -ls
    There is a screen on:
	   2683.pts-0.ip-172-31-7-6	(02/09/21 19:41:19)	(Detached)
     1 Socket in /run/screen/S-ubuntu.
    ```

!!! Note
    Typing `screen -ls` on the original terminal shows you only one screen ID because you have **one screen (i.e. browser window) with two tabs**. You can open another screen window by typing `screen` into the original terminal.

From the output of `screen -ls` above, we use the screen id to reconnect to the screen:

=== "AWS Instance Code"

    ```
    screen -r 2683.pts-0.ip-172-31-7-6
    ```
    or
    ```
    screen -r 2683
    ```

You should see screen 2 that you previously created. Once again you can toggle between screen 2 and screen 3 tabs by typing ++ctrl+a+p++

## Quitting screens

You can quit the `top` output by typing `q` or ++ctrl+c++

To end a screen session, toggle into the session and type:

=== "AWS Console Code"
    ```
    exit
    ```

If no other screen sessions are open, you will fall back to the original SSH terminal (screen 1). If another screen session is open, you will enter that screen session. You can type `exit` until all screen sessions are closed.

!!! Warning
    - Typing `exit` into a screen permanently closes that screen session and all the analyses that are conducted in it.

    - You may need to type `exit` twice to get the "screen is terminating" message. But be sure to check!

    ```
    exit
    There are stopped jobs.

    exit
    [screen is terminating]
    ```
    Typing `exit` too many times will exit the entire terminal!
