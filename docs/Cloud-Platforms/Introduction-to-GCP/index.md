An Introduction to the Google Cloud Platform
============================================

The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides a number of services such as cloud-based computation and storage. All services are available through the platform's console page, which also monitors account billing and user permissions/roles. GCP cloud computing resources are useful for conducting large-scale genomic analyses that would otherwise take too long or crash local computers.

In this tutorial, we'll set up a GCP billing account and demonstrate how to use two GCP services: Google Compute Engine and Google Storage buckets.

Est. Time | Lesson name | Description
--- | --- | ---
15 mins  | [Setting up a GCP account](./gcp1.md) | How to set up a GCP billing account?
30 mins  | [Setting up a GCP instance](./gcp2.md) | How to start a GCP instance?
30 mins  | [Example 1: BLAST analysis](./gcp3.md) | How to do a BLAST search on GCP?
30 mins  | [Example 2: Download SRA data](./gcp4.md) | How to download SRA data on GCP?

!!! note "Learning Objectives"

    - introduce researchers to cloud computing resources and how to use them

    - learn how to connect to an instance (virtual server) on the Google Cloud Platform to do a simple protein BLAST search and download SRA data.

    - learn how to transfer files to or from the instance using Google Storage buckets

    - learn how to terminate an instance

=== "Est. Cost"

    < $1.00 to run both examples

=== "Prerequisites"

    - Technology: Users must be comfortable with using a terminal window (GCP shell provided in the interface). Please use the **Chrome web browser** for setting up and connecting to a GCP virtual machine. Some GCP features do not work on other web browsers.

    - Financial: Users need a valid credit card to set up a GCP billing account. However, new users are eligible for a free 3-month $300 trial, which can be activated during billing account set up.
