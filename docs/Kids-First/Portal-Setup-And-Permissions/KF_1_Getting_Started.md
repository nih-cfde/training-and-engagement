Getting Started with Kids First Data
====================================

The [NIH Common Fund-supported Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource
Center](https://kidsfirstdrc.org/) enables researchers, clinicians, and
patients to work together to accelerate research and promote new
discoveries for children affected with cancer and structural birth
defects. Data from over 11,000 samples, including DNA and RNA, is
available to empower your research today. Data collected from more than
30,000 samples are expected to be available in the next few years.

Our aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for
working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with
less pain. **The goal of this training module is to enable clinician
researchers to use the data portal to build cohorts, and to move that
data to an analysis platform ([Cavatica](https://cavatica.squarespace.com/))**.
