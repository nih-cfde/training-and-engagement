## Register for Cavatica
------------------------

#### Step 1 Go to the Cavatica website

First, we'll set up our accounts at Cavatica by going to this link:

[https://cavatica.squarespace.com/](https://cavatica.squarespace.com/)

!!! Tip

    Open the link in a new tab by right clicking the link and selecting
    'open in a new tab'; or by holding `command` while you
    click the link (MacOS); or by holding `Ctrl` while you click
    the link (Windows)


#### Step 2 Click the Access Data link

That should have taken you to the Kids First and Cavatica Welcome page.
Scroll to the bottom and click on the `Access Data`.

#### Step 3 Click the Account Creation link

As with Kids First, Cavatica offers multiple ways to log in: eRA Commons
ID or a user name and password. Since we don't yet have accounts, we
need to register, by clicking `New to Cavatica? Create an
account` indicated with the purple arrow below:

#### Step 4 Choose your login system

You should now have the option to continue using an eRA Commons ID, or
by setting up a user name and password.

-   If you have an eRA Commons ID, choose `login with with eRA
    Commons` and log in using your credentials.
-   If you don't have an eRA Commons ID, choose `Continue with email
    and password` and then fill out the form and click
    `Register`.

!!! Important

    While you will be able to explore data in the Cavatica regardless of
    which mechanism you choose, moving data from Kids First and doing
    research requires that you have the proper authorization to view and use
    human data, even if that data is officially 'open'. If you have one,
    you should opt to login using your eRA Commons ID.


#### Step 5 Click the email link

Once your registration is complete, you should get a prompt to go check
your email:

![Cavatica Registration Prompt](../../images/Cavatica_3.png "Cavatica Registration Prompt")

You will need to follow the link in that email to complete your
registration.
