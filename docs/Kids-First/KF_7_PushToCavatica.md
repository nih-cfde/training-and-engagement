Push to Cavatica
================

## Check settings

Before you start, check your Kids First settings (under you name on the top right) to make sure Data Repository Integrations are connected. Your screen should look like this:

![KFDRC Portal Settings Page](../images/kf_settings_10.png "KFDRC Portal Settings Page")

## Set filters and choose files

Go back to your [File Repository](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/search/file) tab. We are currently looking at data under the CBTTC. Check to make sure the you have the following data filters and/or set these filters:


**Clinical Filters**:

- Diagnosis Category --> Cancer

- Diagnosis (Source Text) --> high grade glioma

![Clinical Filters](../images/Clinical_Filters_11.png "Clinical Filters")

**File Filters**:

- Experiment Strategy --> RNA-Seq

- File Format --> tsv

![File Filters](../images/File_Filters_12.png "File Filters")

On the main screen, scroll to the bottom and select the number of files you wish to view at one time (see blue circle in the clinical filters image above).

There are a total of 405 files available with these filters. Select the files you wish to analyze in Cavatica by checking the box next to File ID.

!!! Important
    You can only view a maximum of 100 files at a time, so if you wish to push individual files across multiple pages, you would have to perform the pushing process multiple times.

    If you want to push ALL available files, leave all file IDs unchecked. For the purposes of this tutorial, let's leave the boxes unchecked.

## Push to Cavatica

To view and analyze these files in Cavatica, click the large purple **"ANALYZE IN CAVATICA"** button.

A message box pops up. In this case, we are authorized to copy 399 (out of 405) files. You need a Cavatica project to assign the files to. Click "Create a project" and name your project "{Last name} practice lesson".

!!! note
    You can also create projects from Cavatica. In Cavatica, under the 'Projects' tab, click on the purple '+ Create a project' button and enter a project name. Then click 'Create'. Your project name should now show up as an option in the Kids First portal when you click the 'Analyze in Cavatica' button.
