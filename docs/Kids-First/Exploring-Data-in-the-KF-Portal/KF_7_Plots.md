Cohort Results Plots
--------------------

The other big change on this page is that all of the plots have
dynamically updated, and this section has been renamed from "All data"
to "Cohort Results for Query":

![**Cohort Results Plots**](../../images/KidsFirstPortal_18.png)

The most notable difference here, is that the distribution in the "Age
at Diagnosis" plot in the center bottom has narrowed dramatically,
which is expected given our query. All of the plots shown in this
section respond dynamically to the query buttons, but they also can be
used to build and refine queries, or to see extra information. For
instance, if you hover your mouse pointer over a bar in the
\'Experimental Strategy\' plot of the "Available Data" section,
you\'ll get the count of that bar and its x-axis label:

![**Extra Plot Information**](../../images/KidsFirstPortal_19.png)

You can continue to filter and refine your cohort by clicking on the bar
in a chart or slices in a pie chart. Note that each time you make a
selection in a plot, that filter is added to your query box above.

!!! Exercise

    Click a bar in the `Studies` plot to include only samples
    from the Kids First Neuroblastoma data set.


If you applied this filter successfully, you should see something like
the following:

![**Filtered by age and study**](../../images/KidsFirstPortal_23.png)

!!! Note

    We ran this query in early 2020. If you are doing this tutorial later,
    you may see more participants.
