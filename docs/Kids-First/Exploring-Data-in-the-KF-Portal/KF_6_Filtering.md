Filter Buttons
==============

![Exploring Data Filters](../../images/KidsFirstPortal_14.png "Exploring Data Filters")

To use the filter buttons, click on one, choose from the options in that button, and click "apply".

=== "Exercise"

    Use the "Clinical" button to filter the data to include only samples where the patient was between 0 and 5 years old when they were diagnosed. 

=== "Answer"

    Click "Clinical" then "Age at Diagnosis". Choose "between" in the first dropdown, check "year" in the middle, and then type the numbers 0 in the "from" box
    and 5 in the "to" box. Click "Apply".

    If you applied this filter successfully, you should see something like
    the following:

    ![Successful Filter](../../images/KidsFirstPortal_15.png "Successful Filter")

Several things about the page have now changed. First, there is now
information in our queries box.

![Queries](../../images/KidsFirstPortal_16.png "Queries")

It now says what query we are currently looking at, and how many
participants are in our query. Note that it says we chose ages between 0
and 1826.25, which means it automatically calculated 0-5 years in days.
