    abstract = "<p>Pangeo[1] is a community-driven effort for open-source big data initially focused on the Earth System Sciences. One of its primary goals is to enable scientists in analyzing petascale datasets both on classical high-performance computing (HPC) and on public cloud infrastructure. In only a few years, Pangeo has grown into a very productive community collaborating on the development of open-source analysis tools for science. It provides a set of example deployments based on open-source Scientific Python packages like Jupyter[2], Dask[3], and Xarray[4] that bring together scientists and developer with their actual use-cases. In this paper, we first describe Pangeo ecosystem and community. We then present its impact on the work of scientists from CNES on the HPC deployment there. We conclude with a future outlook for Pangeo in this agency and beyond.</p>",
