# README.md

This directory is for syncing the HackMD versions of lessons with GitHub so that we can track changes and maintina a source file. 

## Workflow

- From the master branch, open the lesson file of interest (e.g. UNIX.md, AWD.md) and click the edit button.
- Make a change and save it to a new branch named after the specific workshop (e.g. jan-workshop, feb-workshop). Do NOT create a PR.
- Go to [HackMd](https://hackmd.io/). Ckick "New note" then "Pull from GitHub". Select the GitHub repo and the lesson file. (You made need to authorize a new repo if this is your first time.) Accept all the changes. 
- Modify the HackMD for the workshop. Make as many commits as you like. After the workshop, push the final version to GitHub.
- In GitHub, edit the lesson on the workshop-specific branch to remove any dates or other workshop-specific details.  
- Open a PR to merge any chagnes that were made to the lesson into the master branch. Merge the PR.
