## Contributing

There are multiple ways to contribute to the [Training and Engagement Repository](training-and-engagement).

Frequently asked questions are posted on the [Discussions Board](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/discussions). Topics include AWS, Common Fund, Conda, RNA-Seq, Snakemake, and more. If you have a GitHub account, you can start a new discussion or contribute to existing discussions.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/wiki) contains lesson notes from workshops and resources for instructors and attendees. Only instructors and administrators should edit these pages. If you have questions or comments about the wiki, please email [support@cfde.atlassian.net](mailto:support@cfde.atlassian.net) or [open an issue](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/issues/new).

The `stable` branch of this repository builds the public [training website](https://training.nih-cfde.org) for the `[docs/](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/tree/dev/docs)` directory. The `dev` branch contains updates that will be merged as part of the next [release](https://github.com/nih-cfde/training-and-engagement/releases). If you would like to submit a new lesson, please read the [website style guide](https://training.nih-cfde.org/en/latest/Website-Style-Guide/). To suggest changes or add files, fork the repo and open a pull request against the `dev` branch.
